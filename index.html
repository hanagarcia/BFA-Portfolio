    <h2>"Bio"</h2>
    <p>Hana Garcia is an digital media artist hailing from Brawley, California in the Imperial Valley.
     Hana is interested in using the digital space to create art and in making the viewing of art accessible online.
     She draws a lot of her inspiration for her work from living in the extreme heat of the desert southwest. Using that experience of living
     in an extreme place, Hana uses that in her art to capture some of the extremes she has witnessed or imagines. From the extreme chaos of the 
     2020 news cycle to capturing pictures of friends in the flower fields that are only grown when temptures are over 110 degrees, the extremes
     of life have become a muse to Hana.

     Hana has experience working in data bending, agumented reality, 3D modeling, photography, coded art, website building, Adobe Illustrator,
     Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Premiere, and Adobe After Effects. Hana is currently pursuing a bachelor's in fine arts degree in
     digital media art at San Jose State University. Her artwork has been shown at the California Midwinter Fair, and at art gallery for gender
     and body positivity hosted by SJSU Gender Equity Center. Her work has been used by the San Jose State University Spartan Marching Band and
     by the Phi class of the Lambda Psi Chapter of Kappa Kappa  Psi at San Jose State University.
